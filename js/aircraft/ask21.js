// Schleicher ASK 21, two-seat glider, 600 kg.
//
// Published, and where from:
//   EASA TCDS EASA.A.221 issue 6: span 17.00 m, wing area 17.95 sq m, maximum mass 600 kg, maximum
//     mass of the non-lifting parts 410 kg, CG 234 to 469 mm aft of the wing leading edge at the
//     root rib, speeds.
//   ASK 21 maintenance manual (technical data): root chord 1.50 m, tip 0.50 m, Wortmann FX S 02-196
//     and FX 60-126 sections, dihedral 4 deg, root incidence +2 deg, ailerons 2.80 m span with
//     0.24 to 0.16 m chord, travel 110 mm up and 45 mm down at 240 mm (26.5 / 10.8 deg),
//     Schempp-Hirth airbrakes on the upper surface 1.35 m long and 0.13 m high, tailplane 3.1 m
//     and 1.92 sq m rigged at 0 deg, elevator 30 % chord with 22.5 deg up and 16.3 deg down, fin
//     1.37 m high and 1.357 sq m with 0.80 / 1.17 m chords, rudder 33 % chord and +-28 deg.
//   ASK 21 flight manual (April 1980): length 8.35 m, MAC 1.121 m with its leading edge 8 mm aft of
//     the datum, empty mass about 360 kg, stall at 600 kg 74 km/h with the airbrakes closed and
//     77 km/h with them out, approach 90 km/h, and a 45 deg dive with the airbrakes out settling
//     at 232 km/h. Best glide 34 at 90 km/h: Schleicher and Jane's 1988-89.
// Estimated, and how:
//   Measured off the three-view in the ASK 21 Mi flight manual (the same airframe) against the
//     published span and length: the ailerons run from 5.2 to 8.0 m, the airbrakes from 2.78 to
//     4.13 m, the leading edge is straight, and the tailplane, fin and three wheels stand where
//     they are put here. The chord at the aileron root (1.00 m; 0.98 on the drawing) is the one
//     that makes the two tapers return the published area. Twist is not published: 2 deg of
//     washout, to stand for the change of section along the span as well.
//   Airbrakes: the drag is the value that holds the published 45 deg dive at 232 km/h (the model
//     settles at 231). The lift loss, 5.3 deg over the spoiled strips, is sized from the published
//     3 km/h rise in stall speed; the model applies it as a shift of the zero-lift angle, which
//     costs lift on the approach but hardly moves the stall itself.
//   Inertias: radii of gyration for a two-seat glider, Rx 0.22 of b/2 (two 95 kg wing panels,
//     600 kg less the 410 kg of non-lifting parts, each with a radius of gyration of 0.38 of the
//     semi-span), Ry 0.38 of L/2 and Rz 0.39 of (b+L)/4 as for Roskam's light singles.
//   Control power: thin-aerofoil flap effectiveness for the published chord ratios, times the
//     plain-flap correction for the deflection. Fin lift slope: Helmbold at 1.5 times the
//     geometric aspect ratio (1.383), the tailplane on top acting as an end plate.
//   Section values and the fuselage drag area are tuned inside physical ranges.
// Not modelled: winch and aerotow launch, the slight forward sweep, the wheel brake being worked
//   by the last of the airbrake lever's travel.
